# Battle CP - Rules of Engagement

## 1. The Objective
Destroy the enemy fleet before time runs out. If time expires, the player with the most ships remaining wins.

## 2. Phase 1: Deployment
- Place your 5 ships (Carrier, Battleship, Cruiser, Submarine, Destroyer) on the 10x10 grid.
- Ships cannot overlap or touch edges (standard rules).
- Both players must confirm placement to begin combat.

## 3. Phase 2: Combat & Heat
- **Firing:** Click a cell on the enemy grid to fire.
- **Heat System:** Every shot generates **Heat**.
    - If you reach **7 Heat**, your weapons **OVERHEAT**.
    - You CANNOT fire while overheated.
- **Cooling Down:**
    - **Passive:** Heat decays by 1 every second.
    - **Active:** Solve a Codeforces problem to instantly flush all heat.

## 4. The Veto Mechanic
- You have **3 Vetoes**.
- If you are in a bad spot or need a strategic pause, you can activate a **VETO**.
- **Effect:** The game state locks. No one can fire.
- **To Unlock:** You MUST solve the assigned Codeforces problem.
- **Penalty:** If you fail to solve it within the time limit (7-15 mins), your weapons remain locked while your opponent is free to fire.

## 5. Tie-Breakers
If the game timer (e.g., 1 minute) ends:
1. **Primary:** Most ships remaining wins.
2. **Secondary:** If ships are equal, most Codeforces problems solved wins.
3. **Tertiary:** Sudden Death (Next hit wins).
